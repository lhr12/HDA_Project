\section{Research Question and
Rationale}\label{research-question-and-rationale}}

\textless{}Paragraph detailing the rationale for your analysis. What is
the significant application and/or interest in this topic? Connect to
environmental topic(s)/challenge(s).\textgreater{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Land use has a large impact on nutrient runoff into streams, lakes,
  and other water bodies
\item
  Minnesota has wide variety of land uses. Inlcudes large urban centers,
  natural lands, and agricultural area.
\item
  Nutrient management has been a challenge for states in the effort to
  control harmful algal blooms and coastal dead zones.
\item
  Understanding the causes of nutrient problems will better inform
  management strategies.
\end{itemize}

\textless{}Paragraph detailing your research question(s) and goals. What
do you want to find out? Include a sentence (or a few) on the dataset
you are using to answer this question - just enough to give your reader
an idea of where you are going with the analysis.\textgreater{}

Research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What are the predictors of nutrients based on land use in watersheds
  in the state of Minnesota?
\item
  How do you characterize seasonal variation between the predictors of
  nutrients?
\end{enumerate}

Goals: * Determine how land use, watershed size, and ecoregion explain
variation in nutrient loading indicators. * Discern whether there a
seasonal trends in nutrient loading indicators based on land use types,
watershed size, and ecoregion. * Provide insight to inform decisions
about nutrient managment practices based on land use types, watershed
size, and ecoregion.

\hypertarget{dataset-information}{%
\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

\textless{}Information on how the dataset for this analysis were
collected, the data contained in the dataset, and any important pieces
of information that are relevant to your analyses. This section should
contain much of same information as the README file for the dataset but
formatted in a way that is more narrative.\textgreater{}

The data used in this analysis include data from the Lake Multi-Scaled
Geospatial and Temporal Database (LAGOSNE) and the EPA ecoregion spatial
datasets.

LAGOSNE is a collection of several data modules that contain information
on lakes in the northern United States. The modules contain data from
thousands of lakes in 17 states in the northeastern and midwestern
United States, from Missouri to Maine. The dataset includes a complete
list of all lakes bigger than 4 hectacres in the 17 state area, and
water quality data on a large number of lakes, spanning every state.

Ecoregions are used by planning managers to understand the type of land
use that occurs in different regions of the United States. There are
different levels of ecoregions. Level 1 divides North America into 15
ecological regions, while Level IV offers fine ecological resolution for
each state. This data was published by the U.S. EPA Office of Research
and Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects
Research Laboratory (NHEERL). For the purposes of our project, we
selected Level III ecoregions because they appear to offer a descriptive
narrative of the land use patterns of Minnesota without making a
`distinction without a difference'.

\textless{}Add a table that summarizes your data structure. This table
can be made in markdown text or inserted as a \texttt{kable} function in
an R chunk. If the latter, do not include the code used to generate your
table.\textgreater{}

\newpage

\hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis-and-wrangling}{%
\section{Exploratory Data Analysis and
Wrangling}\label{exploratory-data-analysis-and-wrangling}}

\textless{}Include R chunks for 5+ lines of summary code (display code
and output), 3+ exploratory graphs (display graphs only), and any
wrangling you do to your dataset(s).\textgreater{}

\textless{}Include text sections to accompany these R chunks to explain
the reasoning behind your workflow, and the rationale for your
approach.\textgreater{}

\newpage

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\textless{}Include R chunks for 3+ statistical tests (display code and
output) and 3+ final visualization graphs (display graphs
only).\textgreater{}

\textless{}Include text sections to accompany these R chunks to explain
the reasoning behind your workflow, rationale for your approach, and the
justification of meeting or failing to meet assumptions of
tests.\textgreater{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First we will create correlation plots in order to eliminate variables
  with a correlation greater than 0.8.
\item
  Then we will run Shapiro-Wilkes tests to determine normality and the
  need for possible data transformations.
\item
  After determining the distributions of the data, then we will generate
  mixed effect linear models with chlorophyll a and secchi depth as
  response variables, land use and watershed size as fixed effects, and
  ecoregion as a random effect.
\end{itemize}

Final figures will include: * 6 maps of the state, each showing the
relationship between land use and both response variables. Ecoregion
will be included as a base layer for each map. * Scatter plots showing
the strongest relationships between land use and the response variables.
* Table showing results of linear model.

\newpage

\hypertarget{summary-and-conclusions}{%
\section{Summary and Conclusions}\label{summary-and-conclusions}}

\textless{}Summarize your major findings from your analyses. What
conclusions do you draw from your findings? Make sure to apply this to a
broader application for the research question you have
answered.\textgreater{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Conclusions will include a discussion of our results within the
  context of MN nutrient management plan.
\end{itemize}
