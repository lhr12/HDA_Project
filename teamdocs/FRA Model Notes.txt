Do the season column
Transform dates to Julian Day?
Define the land use classes (hopefully four or five)

One test alternative is create a dataframe for each season or month (if you want). and analyze them separately.

Is lake ID a variable that we want to use? probably not. 

Graph that we can do is response variable versus types of land use. and color or fill by Julian Day. Or Day of the year.


For the seasonality just divide the dataframe in season an see if the coeff change a lot. Always use mixed effects for ecoregions.
